# RockScissorsPaper

The smart contract creates rooms for two players to play, it is also possible to place bets, the winner takes all, if there is a tie, the pot is divided equally.

Implementation: 

```
Rock = 1
Scissors = 2
Paper = 3

first player win

1 - 2 = -1 rock beats scissors
2 - 3 = -1 scissors beats paper
3 - 1 = 2 paper beats rock

second player win

3 - 2 = 1
1 - 3 = -2 
2 - 1 = 1 
```
